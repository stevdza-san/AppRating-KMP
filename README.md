<p align="center">
A <b>Kotlin Multiplatform</b> library, used to display a customizable App Rating dialog, prompting users to leave a review on the Play Store (Android) or App Store (iOS). The library supports configurable intervals for showing the dialog, ensuring a non-intrusive yet effective way to gather app reviews.

## Features

- Kotlin Multiplatform Support: Works seamlessly on both `Android` and `iOS`.
- Customizable Intervals: Show the app rating dialog monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or yearly.
- Initial Delay: Configure an initial delay period `(minimum 5 days)` before showing the dialog.
- User Acknowledgement: If the user cancels the dialog, it will `reset` the interval. If the user clicks a button to leave a review, the dialog will `not` show again.
- Customizable UI: Fully customizable text, colors, and styles for the dialog.
- Lightweight and Easy to Integrate: Minimal setup and configuration required.

## Installation
Add the library dependency to your `commonMain` source set:

```gradle
implementation("com.stevdza-san:app-rating:1.0.0")
```

## Usage
Integrate the `AppRatingDialog` at the top level of your UI hierarchy, such as alongside your `NavHost` in a Jetpack Compose application.

### Basic
```kotlin
@Composable
fun MainScreen() {

    AppRatingDialog(
        playStoreLink = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=PACKAGE_NAME",
        appStoreLink = "https://apps.apple.com/app/YOUR_APP/ID",
        interval = Interval.Monthly
    )

    ..
}
```

### Customization
```kotlin
AppRatingDialog(
    playStoreLink = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=PACKAGE_NAME",
    appStoreLink = "https://apps.apple.com/app/YOUR_APP/ID",
    initialDelayInDays = 7, // The initial period when the first dialog should show
    interval = Interval.Quarterly, // Interval for showing the dialog
    title = { Text(text = "Enjoying our App?") },
    content = { Text(text = "If you're happy with the app, please leave us a review!") },
    dismissText = "No thanks",
    confirmText = "Rate now",
    onDismiss = { /* Handle dismiss action */ }
)
```

### Intervals
The library supports the following intervals for showing the dialog after the initial delay:

- Interval.Monthly
- Interval.Quarterly
- Interval.SemiAnnually
- Interval.Yearly

The dialog will only show after the specified interval has passed since the last interaction.

### Initial delay
You can specify an initial delay (in days) before the dialog is shown for the first time. The default and minimum value is 5 days, but you can set it to any value greater than or equal to 5.

### Reset
If the user clicks a Negative button, the dialog's timestamp is reset, and the dialog will appear again at the next interval. If the user clicks a Positive button on the other hand, the operation should be considered as complete, and the dialog will not show again.
